Please create a memory entry for this session and update the category tree as necessary. Use the following format for the memory entry:
Category: [Determined Category Path]
Session [Number] | [Date] | [Topic]

Short Form:
[One or few lines summary]

Long Form:
[Detailed summary with key points and specifics]

Analyze the sessionâ€™s content to determine the best category path. If needed, create new categories or subcategories, or adjust the existing tree structure.

**Current Category Tree:**
[User to insert current category tree here]

**Expected Output:**
- The new memory entry with its assigned category path.
- An updated category tree reflecting any changes (e.g., new nodes or reorganizations).
- A brief explanation of any changes made to the category tree.
- If significant changes were made to the memory system, create an entry under "Maintenance History" summarizing those changes.

This way, I can directly replace my `categories.md` file with the updated tree structure.
