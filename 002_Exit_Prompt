Please create a memory entry for this session and update the category tree as necessary. Use the following format for the memory entry:

**Memory Entry Format:**
Category: [Determined Category Path]
Session [Number] | [Date] | [Topic]

**Short Form:**
[One or few lines summary]

**Long Form:**
[Detailed summary with key points and specifics]

Analyze the session's content to determine the best category path. If needed, create new categories or subcategories, or adjust the existing tree structure.

**Current Category Tree:**
[User to insert current category tree here]

**Expected Output:**
- The new memory entry with its assigned category path.
- An updated category tree reflecting any changes (e.g., new nodes or reorganizations).
- A brief explanation of any changes made to the category tree.
- **Storing the memory entry (including directory and filename).**
- **Updating `short_memories.md` files in the relevant directories.**
- If significant changes were made to the memory system, create a maintenance history entry summarizing those changes, using this format:
Session [Number] | [Date] | Memory System Update | [Summary of changes]


**Next Steps for User:**
1. **Store the Memory Entry:**
   - Create or navigate to the directory corresponding to the category path: `[Category Path]`.
   - Save the memory entry in a file named `session_[Number].md` within that directory.
   - For example, if the category path is "Projects > Scripts > CVSS Tools", store the memory in `projects/scripts/cvss_tools/session_001.md`.
2. **Update `short_memories.md` Files:**
   - Append the short summary to the `short_memories.md` file in the memory's category directory and all parent directories up to the root.
   - For example, add the short summary to:
     - `projects/scripts/cvss_tools/short_memories.md`
     - `projects/scripts/short_memories.md`
     - `projects/short_memories.md`
     - `short_memories.md` (root)
3. **Update the Category Tree:**
   - If the category tree was updated, replace the contents of `categories.md` with the new tree structure provided.
   - If new directories were created in the tree, ensure the corresponding directories exist in your file system.
4. **Store Maintenance History (if applicable):**
   - If a maintenance history entry was created, append it to `maintenance_history.md` in the root directory.

**Guidelines for "Next Steps for User":**
- Provide the exact directory path and filename for storing the memory entry (e.g., `projects/scripts/cvss_tools/session_001.md`).
- Instruct the user to append the short summary to `short_memories.md` in the memoryâ€™s category directory and all parent directories up to the root.
- If the category tree is updated, instruct the user to replace `categories.md` and create any new directories.
