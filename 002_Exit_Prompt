Session [Number] | [Date] | [Topic]

**Short Form:**

[User to insert current category tree here]

**Expected Output:**
- The new memory entry with its assigned category path.
- An updated category tree reflecting any changes (e.g., new nodes or reorganizations).
- A brief explanation of any changes made to the category tree.
- If significant changes were made to the memory system, create a maintenance history entry summarizing those changes, using this format:
Session [Number] | [Date] | Memory System Update | [Summary of changes]


**Next Steps for User:**
1. **Store the Memory Entry:**
   - Create or navigate to the directory corresponding to the category path: `[Category Path]`.
   - Save the memory entry in a file named `session_[Number].md` within that directory.
   - For example, if the category path is "Projects > Scripts > CVSS Tools", store the memory in `projects/scripts/cvss_tools/session_001.md`.
2. **Update the Category Tree:**
   - If the category tree was updated, replace the contents of `categories.md` with the new tree structure provided.
   - If new directories were created in the tree, ensure the corresponding directories exist in your file system.
3. **Store Maintenance History (if applicable):**
   - If a maintenance history entry was created, append it to `maintenance_history.md` in the root directory.
