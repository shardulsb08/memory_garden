**Memory Maintenance Session**

I am initiating a memory maintenance session to optimize and reorganize the memory retention system. This system simulates continuity across chat sessions by manually managing memory templates, which are summaries of past discussions organized by category paths in a tree-like structure.

**Memory Retention System Overview:**
- **Memory Templates**: Summaries of past sessions stored in a structured format:
Category: [Category Path]
Session [Number] | [Date] | [Topic] | [Key Points] | [Action Items or Scripts]

- **Category Tree**: A dynamic, tree-like structure that organizes memories under categories and subcategories (e.g., "Projects > Scripts > CVSS Tools"). The tree adapts to cover all aspects of my life and updates based on the progression of our discussions.
- **Memory Forms**: Each memory entry has a short form (one or few lines summary) and a long form (detailed summary).
- **Maintenance History**: A separate record tracking changes and optimizations made during maintenance sessions, stored in `maintenance_history.md`.

**Purpose of Maintenance:**
- Review and optimize the category tree for clarity and efficiency.
- Consolidate similar memories or archive outdated ones.
- Adjust category paths or create new nodes as needed.
- Ensure the system remains organized as it grows.
- **Assess and suggest improvements to the prompts (e.g., Start-of-Session, Exit, Maintenance Window) to enhance clarity, usability, or functionality.**

**Instructions for This Session:**
1. I will provide the current category tree and a list of all memory entries. Ask me if I don’t.
2. Analyze the category tree and memory entries to identify opportunities for optimization, such as:
 - Merging redundant categories.
 - Archiving old or less relevant memories.
 - Renaming categories for better clarity.
 - Creating new categories or subcategories to accommodate new topics.
 - Any other optimization scope that you may find.
3. Propose an updated category tree structure that better organizes the memories based on my life’s journey and the progression of our discussions.
4. Suggest any memory entries that should be consolidated, archived, or updated.
5. **Evaluate the current prompts and suggest any improvements to enhance their clarity, usability, or functionality.**
6. If changes are made to the category tree or memory entries, provide instructions on how to update the `short_memories.md` files accordingly. When providing these instructions, specify which directories (including parent directories up to the root) need their `short_memories.md` files updated based on the changes made.
7. At the end of the session, create a maintenance history entry summarizing the changes, using this format:
Session [Number] | [Date] | Memory Maintenance | [Summary of changes and optimizations]


**Current Category Tree:**
[Insert current category tree here]

**Memory Entries:**
[Insert all memory entries here, including their category paths]

**Expected Output:**
- An updated category tree.
- A list of memory entries to consolidate, archive, or update.
- **Suggestions for improving the prompts, if any.**
- Instructions for updating `short_memories.md` files based on any changes made.
- A brief explanation of changes made.
- A maintenance history entry summarizing this session.

**Next Steps for User:**
1. **Update the Category Tree:**
- Replace the contents of `categories.md` with the updated category tree provided.
- If new directories were created in the tree, ensure the corresponding directories exist in your file system.
2. **Handle Memory Entries:**
- For any memory entries suggested for consolidation, archiving, or updating, make the necessary changes in their respective files.
- For archived memories, consider moving them to an "archive" subdirectory within their category path.
3. **Update `short_memories.md` Files:**
- Follow the provided instructions to update `short_memories.md` files in the affected directories.
4. **Implement Prompt Improvements:**
- If suggestions for improving the prompts are provided, update the relevant prompt files (e.g., `001_Start_of_Session_Prompt.txt`, `002_Exit_Prompt`, `003_Maintenance_Window_Prompt`) with the recommended changes.
5. **Store Maintenance History:**
- Append the provided maintenance history entry to `maintenance_history.md` in the root directory.
